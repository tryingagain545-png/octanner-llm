    "mitigation": "Recommended Security Measures:\n1. **Input Validation & Sanitization**\n   - Implement strict input validation\n   - Filter dangerous keywords and patterns\n   - Use allowlists for specific operations\n\n2. **Prompt Engineering**\n   - Use role-based system prompts with clear boundaries\n   - Implement prompt templates with strict structure\n   - Add explicit refusal instructions for dangerous requests\n\n3. **Output Filtering**\n   - Monitor outputs for leaked system prompts\n   - Implement semantic filtering for suspicious responses\n   - Use detection models for jailbreak attempts\n\n4. **Rate Limiting & Anomaly Detection**\n   - Implement rate limiting per user\n   - Monitor for suspicious patterns (repeated failures, unusual queries)\n   - Alert on potential attack sequences\n\n5. **Defense in Depth**\n   - Use multiple layers of detection\n   - Combine LLM-based and rule-based filtering\n   - Implement user authentication and audit logging\n\n6. **Regular Testing**\n   - Run PromptMap scans regularly\n   - Test new attack patterns as they emerge\n   - Conduct red team exercises quarterly",
